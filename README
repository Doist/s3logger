Program s3logger collects json messages over TCP, stores them into
gzip-compressed files split by time and uploads these files to AWS s3
bucket.

Once started, service accepts TCP connections and expects clients to send
streams of json objects over such connections. s3logger only closes
connection itself if it encounters malformed json, otherwise it expects
client to close the connection once it is done with it. s3logger does not
send anything back to the client, it only reads data from the client.

s3logger accumulates received messages over predefined time window (-t flag)
to a temporary log file creating new ones as needed; previous files are
uploaded to s3 bucket in background and removed after successful upload.
Program only writes to a single temporary log file at a time, so json
messages received from multiple concurrent connections are interleaved into
a single json stream. It does its best not to lose messages, but can still
drop them if they're coming faster than could be saved on disk or there's
any disk write error. Stored messages are separated by new line (0xa).

s3logger uploads files to a specified bucket using predefined s3 object
naming scheme:

    dt=2018-02-09/20180209T213803_df718a7818e53243.json.gz

It uses dt=YYYY-MM-DD "directories", object name base starting with date and
time when log file was created (UTC) followed by hex-encoded 64-bit random
value and .json.gz suffix.

Since s3logger uses AWS SDK, s3 bucket credentials should be configured
directly by means supported by SDK. The easiest way to do so is with
environment variables:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1

See
https://godoc.org/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session#hdr-Environment_Variables
for details.

s3logger does not use TLS for its listener at the moment as it is expected
to run on localhost or inside trusted network.

    Usage of s3logger:
      -addr string
        	address to listen (default "localhost:8080")
      -bucket string
        	s3 bucket to upload logs
      -dir string
        	directory to keep unsent files (default "/var/spool/s3logger")
      -t duration
        	time to use single file (min 1m) (default 5m0s)
